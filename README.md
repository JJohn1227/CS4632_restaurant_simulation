# CS4632_restaurant_simulation
Discrete-event simulation of a restaurant service system (CS4632)
Project Overview
This project implements a discrete-event simulation of a restaurant service system for CS 4632 (Modeling and Simulation). The goal of the simulation is to model how customers arrive at a restaurant, wait in a queue if necessary, receive service from available servers, and eventually depart the system.

The simulation focuses on key components commonly found in service systems, including customers, queues, servers, and an event list to manage arrival and service completion events. By modeling these components and their interactions over time, the simulation can be used to study system performance such as customer waiting time, server utilization, and overall time spent in the system.

To keep the model manageable, the simulation makes reasonable simplifying assumptions, such as fixed service behavior and a limited number of servers. The project emphasizes clear system structure, event-driven logic, and alignment with standard modeling concepts such as queueing theory and discrete-event simulation.

This repository contains the project documentation, UML diagrams, and source code that will be developed incrementally throughout the course.
